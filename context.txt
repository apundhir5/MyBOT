I run a a command center that responds to tickets created by team members in my company. 
The tickets are incident tickets, some of the topics shift left, example:
PASSWORD
BLOCKED
ACCESS
ACCOUNT
LOCKED OUT
LOGIN
USER CREATION
PASSWORD RESET
SERVER RESET
DRIVE
NOT SIGNING IN
INVALID CREDENTIAL
RESTART

While some other topics include automation opportunities.
